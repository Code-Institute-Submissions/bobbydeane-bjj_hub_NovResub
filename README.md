![HTML](https://bjjhubproject.s3.amazonaws.com/media/htmlvalidation.jpg)

The CSS was validated using [w3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![CSS](https://bjjhubproject.s3.amazonaws.com/media/cssvalidation.jpg)


## Automated Tests

Automated tests were carried out using Djangos testing functionality.
The tests looked at the Python files in the App to validate the code. The Coverage repost can be found int he htmlcov folder in the app.
![Tests](https://bjjhubproject.s3.amazonaws.com/media/checkout_coverage.jpg)

## Manual Tests

Manual test were carried out on the site by clicking the various buttons and links on the site to check it they give the desired outcome. See details below.

Homepage:

Clicking on the be ready ..shop here banner will tak you to the full store. Clicking on the BJJ HIb logo will take the user back to the homepage.

When the user clicks the ‘all products’ button, they will get a a list of three options. These options allow the user to sort the store via Price, Category, or allow the user to view all products.

Clicking the ‘By Price’ button displays the store contents from cheapest to dearest.

Clicking the ‘By category’ option will display the store and sort the items by their category. Starting with Casual wear, then Equipment, and then Fight wear.
